> Trying to make sense of second language learning as an adult. 


# Explicit Learning 

Explicit learning is defined as a conscious and intentional process where learners actively strive to identify patterns, formulate rules, and test hypotheses about the target language.

This conscious engagement with language rules is primarily associated with the development of grammatical competence.

This knowledge directly contributes to accuracy, which is the ability to use the language precisely and with minimal errors. == suggests that in the initial stages of language learning, prioritizing accuracy through explicit means is crucial for establishing a robust linguistic foundation.==

The deliberate nature of explicit learning, inherently consumes significant cognitive resources, particularly attention and working memory. This high cognitive investment is the fundamental reason why explicit learning feels like *deep concentration* and is challenging to sustain for extended periods.

When learners are presented with more information or tasks than their cognitive system can effectively manage, cognitive overload occurs. 

This presents a paradox: its ==essential nature for accuracy comes with an inherent limitation in sustainability==, underscoring the need for complementary approaches.

# Implicit 

Stephen Krashen famously distinguished between "acquisition" and "learning," a dichotomy that provides foundational terminology for the two observed modes. According to Krashen, acquisition is a subconscious process of incidentally "picking up" a language, akin to how children become proficient in their L1.

Let’s look into SLA building blocks and cycle.

## Input Hypothesis 

i+1

We move forward in the natural order, by understanding the input that contains the structure of the next stage, that is, a little bit above our current level of language ability.

Assume the current level is “i” and the next stage is "i+1"( stage a little higher than the current level).

There is a controversy about the application of the “i+1” mode in actual language teaching. Since teachers cannot grasp the degree to which language input conforms to the definition of “i+1”, therefore, the learner may be provided with “i+1” or “i+3”.

## Interaction Hypothesis 

Interaction involves the *"negotiation of meaning"* a process where learners and their interlocutors adjust their language—through strategies such as clarification requests, repetitions, or comprehension checks—to ensure mutual understanding.

In the interaction between the two parties, there are two adjustments for language input.

One is adjusting the language form, which makes the language input closer to the learners' level.

The other is adjusting the structure and function of discourse, which improves the comprehension of input with the assistance of asking questions, repeating speeches, explaining meanings, and so on.

This refers to the modification of the interactional structure of the conversation itself. It involves the dynamic adjustments made by participants during a conversation to ensure mutual understanding, often through "negotiation of meaning."

   * Example: Consider a conversation between a native speaker (NS) and a non-native speaker (NNS):
     * NNS: "I go to the store... for buy... uh... apple."
     * NS (Clarification Request): "You went to the store to buy apples?" (The NS asks a question to confirm understanding and prompts the NNS to clarify).
     * NS (Confirmation Check): "So, you bought red apples, right?" (The NS seeks confirmation of their understanding).
     * NS (Recast): "Ah, you went to the store to buy apples." (The NS subtly corrects the NNS's grammar by rephrasing the utterance correctly within the flow of conversation, without explicitly pointing out the error).
     * NS (Comprehension Check): "Do you understand what I mean by 'ripe'?" (The NS directly checks if the NNS has understood a specific word or phrase).


Explicit feedback and implicit feedback are two forms of feedback. 

Explicit feedback is a form of direct correction, such as telling the learner the wrong word in their output and explaining the correct usage of the word.

Implicit feedback is a form of indirect correction, including confirmation checks, clarification requests, comprehension checks, Recasts, and other strategies.

## Output Hypothesis 


Swain mentions three important functions of the Output Hypothesis:
1. The noticing function. Through language output, learners can find gaps between the target language and learned language in which their language develops further;
2. The hypothesis testing function. Learners can check their assumptions about language expressions or form by output;
3. The meta-linguistic reflective function. Output can reflect on language problems and encourage learners to discuss them.


However, some researchers argue that learners do not pay attention to language problems in their output even if they are given feedback, or that learners do not have enough meaningful output opportunities in the classroom, so the argument that output is directly decided language acquisition could be regarded as questionable parlance.


### Note on *Retrieval*

## Summary 

To sum up, in the process of second language acquisition, the relationship between input, interaction and output is mutually influenced and interdependent.

## Notes

The "shallow concentration" aspect of this mode stems from the implicit nature of this process, where the primary focus is on conveying meaning rather than on explicit rules, thereby allowing for more sustained and less cognitively draining engagement. 

For adults, implicit learning alone is often insufficient for achieving native-like accuracy, largely due to the pervasive influence of their established first language.




# Declarative & Procedural Memory 

| Feature                    | Declarative Memory                                              | Procedural Memory                                      |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| *Conscious Access*         | Consciously accessible; can be "declared"                       | Largely unconscious; difficult to "declare"            |
| *Type of Knowledge*        | Factual information, rules, concepts (knowing _what_)           | Skills, procedures, automatic actions (knowing _how_)  |
| *Learning Speed*           | Can be learned from single exposure; strengthened by repetition | Requires repeated exposure and extensive practice      |
| *Language Role*            | Vocabulary, consciously learned grammar rules                   | Automatic grammatical processing, fluent production    |
| *Associated Learning Mode* | Explicit learning (conscious analysis)                          | Implicit acquisition (subconscious pattern extraction) |
| *Fatigue/Load*             | More susceptible to cognitive overload and fatigue              | More resilient to fatigue; less cognitive load         |
In essence, declarative memory helps us _know about_ the language (e.g., a grammar rule), while procedural memory helps us _use_ the language automatically and fluently without consciously thinking about the rules. Effective language learning often involves engaging both systems, with explicit knowledge (declarative) sometimes guiding the practice that leads to automatized skills (procedural).





# Thoughts on Michel Thomas technique


While the Michel Thomas method _feels_ intuitive and stress-free, it is a form of **explicit instruction designed to feel implicit**—prioritizing clarity, structure, and guided practice to build a strong speaking foundation quickly.

#### **Key Characteristics of Explicit Learning in the Method:**

- **Structured Rule Introduction:** Each step introduces exactly **one new rule**, enabling conscious understanding of grammar and structure.
    
- **Direct Explanation with Immediate Practice:** Teachers explain rules (e.g., word endings or pronoun usage), then prompt learners to produce examples using those rules.
    
- **Active Hypothesis Testing:** Learners anticipate responses, receive instant correction, and refine output through **conscious trial and error**.
    
- **Error Highlighting:** Teachers actively point out and correct mistakes, drawing attention to form and pronunciation.
    
- **Use of Declarative Memory First:** Early stages rely on conscious knowledge of vocabulary and rules, gradually moving toward automatic (procedural) use through repetition.

## What lacks in the Michel Thomas method that we have in the input interaction output cycle?

1. **Authentic and Diverse Input:**
    
    - **Controlled vs. Natural Input:** While the Michel Thomas method provides carefully sequenced and comprehensible input, it is highly controlled and teacher-mediated. The input is designed to unveil specific grammatical structures and vocabulary in a linear fashion. What it lacks is exposure to the *unfiltered, diverse, and authentic input* that learners would encounter in real-world communicative situations, such as conversations with various native speakers, media (movies, music, news), or literature. The Input Hypothesis emphasizes the need for abundant and high-quality comprehensible input from a variety of sources.  
        
    - **Audio-Only Limitation:** Being an audio-only method, it completely "ignores literacy", meaning it doesn't provide input in written form, which is a crucial aspect of language acquisition and comprehension.
        
2. **Genuine Negotiation of Meaning (Interaction):**
    
    - **Teacher-Controlled Interaction:** Michael Long's Interaction Hypothesis emphasizes "negotiation of meaning," where learners and interlocutors adjust their language to ensure mutual understanding through strategies like clarification requests, repetitions, and comprehension checks. While the Michel Thomas method is interactive, the interaction is largely  teacher-controlled and highly structured. The teacher takes "full responsibility for your understanding", guiding the learner to produce specific, expected answers based on newly introduced rules. This differs from spontaneous negotiation where learners might initiate clarification or struggle to express a complex idea, prompting the interlocutor to modify their language in less predictable ways.
        
    - **Limited Bidirectional Communication:** The interaction is primarily a series of cues and responses, designed to test the application of a rule. There's less opportunity for the learner to initiate topics, ask open-ended questions, or express nuanced thoughts that would lead to genuine, learner-driven negotiation of meaning.
        
    - **Absence of Peer-to-Peer Interaction:** The method explicitly notes that "there didn't seem to be any student-student interaction". The Input-Interaction-Output cycle, particularly within sociocultural theories of SLA, highlights the importance of collaborative learning and interaction with peers, which can reduce cognitive load and provide diverse perspectives. The Michel Thomas method's focus on a single teacher-student dynamic misses this crucial element.  
        
    - **Nature of Feedback:** While immediate and corrective, the feedback can sometimes be perceived as negative or discouraging, with instances of the teacher interrupting or chastising students for guessing. While feedback is vital for refining the interlanguage system , a high "affective filter" (anxiety) can hinder acquisition.  
        
3. **Diverse and Spontaneous Output:**
    
    - **Translation-Based Output:** The Michel Thomas method heavily relies on "translation tasks" where learners translate English sentences into the target language. While this forces active production and "hypothesis testing" , it's a very specific type of output. It doesn't fully prepare learners for generating spontaneous, original thoughts in the target language without the crutch of L1 translation.  
        
    - **Limited Communicative Purpose:** The output is primarily for demonstrating understanding of a rule or vocabulary item, rather than for a genuine communicative purpose (e.g., expressing personal opinions, narrating events, solving problems collaboratively). The Output Hypothesis emphasizes output for "contextualized, meaningful use".  
        
    - **Underdeveloped Meta-Linguistic Reflection:** While output can prompt learners to "reflect on language problems and discuss them" , the Michel Thomas method's fast pace and teacher-led corrections may not provide ample space for learners to engage in this deeper, self-directed meta-linguistic reflection.  
        

In summary, while the Michel Thomas method excels at providing structured, explicit input and immediate, guided output to build a strong foundational understanding and initial fluency in a low-stress environment, it falls short in providing the breadth of authentic input, the dynamic and learner-initiated negotiation of meaning, and the diverse communicative contexts for output that are integral to a holistic and advanced second language acquisition process.
